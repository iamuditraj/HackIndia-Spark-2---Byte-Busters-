## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person has diabetes based on various medical attributes. The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
  cd diabetes-prediction

Install the required dependencies:
